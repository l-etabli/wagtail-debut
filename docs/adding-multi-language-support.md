# Adding multi language support

Wagtail and Pipit assumes by default that all content comes in a single language, to add support for multiple languages you need to do the following:

1. Install `wagtail_localize` (`pip install wagtail_localize`)

2. Add `"wagtail_localize"` and `"wagtail_localize.locales"` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

3. Update `wagtail/pipit/settings/base.py` with the following:

```python
WAGTAIL_I18N_ENABLED = True
...
WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = LANGUAGES = [
    # Any language you whish to support
    ('en', "English"),
    ('fr', "French"),
    ('de', "German"),
]
```

4. Update so you use `i18n_patterns` for routing

```python
from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns

urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
    re_path(r"", include(wagtail_urls)),
)
```

This will make sure languages are served as `example.com/en/about/` and `example.com/sv/om-oss/`

5. Next step is to provide the frontend with both current language for pages and any translations, open `wagtail/main/pages/base_serializer.py` and extend the BaseSerializer like this:

```python
...
class BasePageSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    ...
    language_code = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
    translations = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
    ...

    def get_language_code(self, page):
        return self.locale.language_code

    def get_translations(self, page):
        translations = page.get_translations(inclusive=False)
        return [{
            "title": x.title,
            "url": x.full_url,
            "language_code": x.locale.language_code,
        } for x in translations]
```

6. Done!
